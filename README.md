# Microsoft Teams task module - C# sample

A task module allows you to create modal popup experiences in your Teams application. Inside the popup, you can run your own custom HTML/JavaScript code, show an `<iframe>`-based widget such as a YouTube or Microsoft Stream video, or display an [Adaptive card](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/).

Task modules build on the foundation of Microsoft Teams tabs: a task module is essentially a tab in a popup window. It uses the same SDK, so if you've built a tab you are already 90% of the way to being able to create a task module.

## Try it yourself

This sample is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading [Task Module CSharp.zip](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Manifest/TaskModuleCSharp.zip) to one of your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant; see [step 6 here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-tenant#turn-on-microsoft-teams-for-your-organization).) The app is running on the free Azure tier, so it may take a while to load if you haven't used it recently and it goes back to sleep quickly if it's not being used, but once it's loaded it's pretty snappy.

## Overview of this sample

* **A personal app.** When you upload the [Task Module CSharp.zip](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Manifest/TaskModuleCSharp.zip) file, choose "Add for you" and "Task Module CSharp" will appear in the "..." menu in the Teams app bar. The personal app has both a tab and a bot.
* **A channel tab.** Add the app to a team, then add a Task Module CSharp tab and choose "Task Module Demo" from the radio button list.
* **A channel bot.** Add the app to a team, then chat with it (@Task Module CSharp).

The tab shows how to invoke the task module using the Teams SDK. Source code for the tab is found in [Tasks.cshtml](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Views/Home/Tasks.cshtml). 

The following task modules are supported:

* YouTube, which is comprised of a [generic template for embedded `<iframe>` experiences](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Views/Shared/_EmbedPage.cshtml) (also used for the PowerApp task module below) plus a [one-line stub containing the YouTube embed URL](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Views/Home/YouTube.cshtml)
* [PowerApp](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Views/Home/PowerApp.cshtml) &mdash; unfortunately it doesn't work out of the box; click the button or see the [source code](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Views/Home/PowerApp.cshtml) for details on how you can customize it for your tenant
* There are two custom form examples:
  * Showing the results of a custom form returned to the tab
  * Showing the results of a custom form returned to the bot
* There are two Adaptive card examples:
  * Showing the results of an `Action.Submit` button returned to the tab
  * Showing the results returned to the bot as a message

The sample app also contains a bot with cards allowing you to invoke these task modules. You can invoke them from an Adaptive card or from a Bot Framework thumbnail card. [RootDialog.cs](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Dialogs/RootDialog.cs) contains the code for the cards, and [MessagesController.cs](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Controllers/MessagesController.cs) contains the code for responding to `task/fetch` and `task/submit` messages.

## Implementation notes

  * Metadata used to generate [TaskInfo objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/task-modules/task-modules-overview#the-taskinfo-object) is in [TaskModel.cs](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Models/TaskModel.cs).
  * Model classes for handling [Bot Framework card actions vs. Adaptive card Action.Submit actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/task-modules/task-modules-bots#bot-framework-card-actions-vs-adaptive-card-actionsubmit-actions) are defined in [CardActionValue.cs](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Models/CardActionValue.cs)
  * Deeplink is generated in [DeeplinkHelper.cs](Microsoft.Teams.Samples.TaskModule.Web/Helper/DeeplinkHelper.cs)
